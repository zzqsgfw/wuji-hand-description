and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- USD model files for NVIDIA Isaac Sim (`usd/left/`, `usd/right/`) with fused meshes, PBR materials (black glove + WUJI logo), physics properties, and collision filter pairs baked in
- Update README with USD directory structure and Isaac Sim usage section

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed

- Fix mesh file paths in URDF files (use relative path `../meshes/right/` or `../meshes/left/` respectively instead of filename only)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed

- Fix robot name in left-hand models (was incorrectly set to "wujihand-right-v1.0.2")
- Fix inertia values
- Fix joint motion range limits
- Fix joint torque limits
- Fix self-collision groups
- Fix RViz fixed frame for right hand visualization

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-19

### Changed

- Remove version suffix from robot name (e.g., `wujihand-left-v1.0.2` → `wujihand-left`)
- Merge separate `display.left.py` and `display.right.py` into unified `display.launch.py` with `hand` parameter
- Exclude `mjcf/` directory from ROS2 installation

### Fixed

- RViz config uses relative topic path `robot_description` instead of absolute `/robot_description`
- This allows RViz running in a ROS2 namespace to correctly subscribe to the robot_description topic

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-27

### Added

- URDF models for Wuji Hand left and right hands
- MJCF (MuJoCo XML) models for simulation
- High-quality STL mesh files for visualization and collision
- ROS2 launch files for left and right hands
- RViz configuration file for robot display
- CMakeLists.txt for ROS2 package build
